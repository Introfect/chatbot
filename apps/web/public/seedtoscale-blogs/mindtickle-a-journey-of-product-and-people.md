Several years ago, a group of young entrepreneurs in Pune, India started a group to take part in gamified knowledge-based treasure hunts. Soon this took off and they realised that when knowledge was delivered in an engaging and exciting manner people were naturally drawn to it -- making it not only more fun but enhancing its retention as well. That’s when they decided to experiment with corporate learning as they thought that workers of the future would want more engaging ways of being prepared for every moment in their careers. They started building out [gamified versions of employee training](https://yourstory.com/2012/04/mindtickle-enriching-employee-learning-and-engagement) for a few local Indian companies. [**MindTickle**](https://www.mindtickle.com/) was born.

[The founders](https://www.seedtoscale.com/people/dinesh-katiyar) were ambitious, but even in their most optimistic moods, none would have likely predicted that MindTickle would be voted as the [#1 software product for the enterprise](https://www.g2.com/best-software-companies/enterprise) globally. And this was achieved while also building the company as [one of the highest rated places to work at](https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-MindTickle-EI_IE543637.11,21.htm), both in India and Silicon Valley.

It has been quite a pioneering journey - one that’s filled with dedication and perseverance. The team has constantly demonstrated a high level of intensity on both its product and its people. On both fronts, MindTickle has strived hard not just to match or marginally be better than others, but to truly be a trendsetter.

MindTickle’s original focus was quite novel for its time - make learning for employees more fun and engaging. Millennials in the workforce found this appealing, and as Gen Z entered the [corporate](https://www.seedtoscale.com/) world, this became table stakes. MindTickle realised that engaged learning was the beginning - much like aerobic training is for Olympic athletes. The focus evolved to add practice, skills development, deeper coaching and training models that are more appropriate for the specific sports that each athlete is involved in -- all of which helps each person reach their full capability.

MindTickle honed in on two aspects that corporations depend on for their long term success - brand and revenue.

1.  A company’s **brand** is only as good as its weakest link, much like any relay race. Every single day, every single employee that represents an enterprise to its various constituents must deliver value in each of their interactions. This can't be achieved without creating the correct behaviours and capabilities .
2.  **Revenue** is like oxygen for a company. The employees responsible for the top-line of an enterprise need to be like the non-stop super-coordinated teamwork-driven basketball or soccer teams at the Olympics. Getting them ready and keeping them at that level of performance is not easy, but that’s the goal MindTickle has set for itself.

Today, MindTickle is busy preparing companies worldwide to bring true Olympics-style readiness for the employees in their most critical functions. MindTickle continues to pay that extra level of attention to its own employees as well. [Workations](https://youtu.be/6Z6WsrEuQR8) and music have been an integral part of the company’s culture, and it continues to find new ways to add [fun and joy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzVeDzP3a4w) even in challenging times.

Armed with a fresh round of [capital](https://www.mindtickle.com/news/sales-readiness-leader-mindtickle-announces-100m-funding-led-by-softbank-vision-fund-2/), MindTickle embarks on the next phase of its inspiring journey, and we are all eager to see what’s next. Team MindTickle, we wish you all the best!
