Early last year, an oft-quoted Gartner report stated that companies are spending over $500 billion on software every year, and more and more of these are delivered as SaaS. 

This is now accepted truth. But the report also stated a few more things.

It said that the selling process is going to become more and more buyer centric, but more importantly in this regard, that millennials are going to be the decision makers, and therefore more digitally oriented and knowledgeable. If treated just as targets or consumers, they will baulk, but given seamless interactions, superior experience and value, they will respond.

Some of this is evident, but was lent urgency by the pandemic’s acceleration of these trends.

And this has changed the game for Martech and Sales.

Companies building in this space have had to understand and deliver on customer success, great UX, reducing the context gap between product, sales, and marketing teams. Add to that remote-selling, which the enterprise world has been forced to adapt to in quick time. Marketers and sales-folks are also interested in more analytics that can help them make decisions, the kind of intelligence that helps them know their ICPs way more effectively than they can right now.

All of these are complexities and problems are being addressed by startups right now. 

And if you are one of them, we have something for you.

As part of our Future of Work Dialogue, we are hosting an event for early stage founders building products in sales and marketing.

This is on 31st March, Wednesday, and founders [can apply here](https://accelindia.typeform.com/to/AYasnzW4).

The Future of Work Dialogue is a series of conversations organised by [Accel](https://www.seedtoscale.com/author/accel-in-india), aimed at founders building, or thinking of building startups aiming to shape the Future of Work.

Each conversation will focus on a particular function, and will have a product leader who has built, or is building a product in the space. Founders will discuss their vision of the future of work, and the opportunities and challenges that come along with it.
