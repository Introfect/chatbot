India's educational landscape is undergoing a quiet revolution, driven by the increasing mobile phone penetration in Bharat—the vast regions of tier-II, tier-III, and rural areas. These regions, home to millions of students, have historically faced challenges in accessing quality education. However, the widespread availability of mobile phones has opened new avenues for learning.

The scale of the opportunity in Bharat is staggering but largely untapped. A closer look at the numbers reveals the scale: in Uttar Pradesh alone, 37 lakh students are enrolled in the Hindi medium UP Board for Class 10th, compared to 21 lakh students in CBSE across the country. This disparity highlights the vast potential within state boards, where students have traditionally lagged due to language barriers and limited access to quality educational resources.

This is where Vidyakul, a vernacular e-learning platform, steps in, aiming to bridge this educational gap and make learning more accessible for these students.

In recent years, mobile phone penetration in Bharat has surged. Today, over 85% of students in Classes 11th and 12th own smartphones, and even in the most remote villages, it is common for a household to have at least one smartphone. This digital access has transformed how education is delivered and consumed in these areas. Vidyakul has capitalized on this shift by offering courses designed to boost exam preparation, delivered directly to students’ smartphones.

Vidyakul’s platform offers live lectures and pre-recorded courses in Hindi, Gujarati, Marathi, and Hinglish, making it accessible to students who are more comfortable learning in their native languages. This approach addresses a significant issue faced by state-board students—the disconnect caused by the dominance of English in online education. By providing content in local languages, Vidyakul not only enhances comprehension but also makes education more engaging.

The impact of this approach is already evident. In Bihar, where Vidyakul first launched, the platform grew from 1,000 paying users in its first year to 40,000 last year. This explosive growth reflects the trust and value Vidyakul has built in these communities. The platform’s focus on quality, trust, and tangible outcomes has created a strong network effect, where success stories inspire others to join, further expanding Vidyakul’s reach.

A critical element of Vidyakul’s success is its understanding of the community dynamics in Bharat. In rural areas, education is not just an individual pursuit but a communal effort. When one student succeeds, it inspires others, creating a ripple effect throughout the village. Vidyakul has tapped into this by providing high-quality education that meets the specific needs of these students, ensuring that they are not left behind in the digital age.

As Vidyakul continues to scale, the focus remains on deepening its penetration in Bharat. Bihar has served as a successful model, and the company is now expanding into Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat, replicating its success. The goal is to provide not just online education but to explore hybrid models that combine the best of both online and offline learning. By offering a comprehensive solution for after-school tutoring, Vidyakul aims to capture a significant share of the unorganized market, where students currently rely on inconsistent local tutoring options.

The platform’s mission is clear: to make quality education available to every student in Bharat, ensuring that language and location are no longer barriers to learning.
