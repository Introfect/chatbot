*Applications now open for Founder Stack - Consumer Tech cohort to support early-stage founders in user growth and product-market fit*

*Apply now on* [*www.seedtoscale.com/courses/sts-consumer*](/courses/sts-consumer)

Launched in February 2020, Founder Stack is a curated community of experts from the consumer tech ecosystem to help early-stage founders scale faster towards PM fit.

*   A community initiative designed to guide early-stage founders, Founder Stack helps founders identify a good market opportunity and supports them on their journey through the product-market fit.

*   Over the years, we have partnered with some of the [best consumer tech companies in India](https://www.failory.com/blog/top-indian-startups) - Flipkart, Swiggy, Urban Company, Vedantu, Cure Fit, Bounce, and others. At the time of investment, these companies were small, just the founders in their first 500 days of their journey.

*   Through the initiative, we would share our learnings from partnering with these companies from seed to scale stages. The cohort will have about 8-10 ambitious founding teams that are trying to solve the pain-points of millions of Indian households, to build startups around them.

*   We started Founder Stack with an intent to be business model specific so that founders get high returns for their time spent with Accel.

For SaaS businesses in India, there are a plethora of community groups for support. When it came to consumer tech, however, we could not find a community that

*   Acts as a knowledge bridge for founders. 
*   Gives founders access to actionable insights 
*   Access to operators and founders in their market category to have quick chats and get feedback loops. 
*   A community of members with a similar objective to build high growth consumer-led businesses.

Hence, we decided to build a closely-knit, high-signal consumer tech founder community.  

This will have - startup founders, operators, experts, consultants, and other support group members to help you.
