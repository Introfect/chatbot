In the heart of Bharat's tier-2 and tier-3 towns, a new model of community engagement is taking shape. As India’s smaller cities and rural areas embrace digital connectivity, Kutumb is standing out by delivering solutions crafted specifically for these regions.

Kutumb, which means family in Hindi, lets users create groups for their communities where members can share news, discuss issues and connect deeply with others in their community. Kutumb now has over 20,000 active communities on the platform and has reached the remotest parts of the country, with its focusing on regional Indian languages including Bengali and Telugu. Unlike WhatsApp, which has group admins with exclusive control and other participants with limited roles, Kutumb allows for customizable group hierarchies, including the ability to create admins and moderators.

Traditionally, social networking platforms have focused on metropolitan centers, offering features that cater primarily to English-speaking users. However, Bharat—spanning Tier 2, Tier 3 cities, and rural areas—has distinct needs and preferences that have often been overlooked.

When Kutumb was founded, the goal was not to impose a predefined solution but to deeply understand and address the inherent needs of the Bharat audience. The initial focus was clear: identify and solve impactful problems faced by tier-two and tier-three towns. Through extensive engagement with local users, it became evident that a dedicated community platform was essential. Thus, Kutumb was born—not as a mere tool, but as a response to the complex social fabric of these areas.

India’s cultural diversity is its strength, yet it also presents a challenge for uniform solutions. Each community within Bharat operates with its own set of languages, traditions, and social norms. Kutumb’s success lies in recognizing these differences while focusing on the common human need for connection and growth. 

Kutumb’s impact is visible across various domains. In the matrimonial sector, where community-based matchmaking is still prevalent, the platform offers a space where users can find partners within their own circles. This localized approach addresses a gap that traditional online platforms often overlook, providing a more meaningful and culturally resonant solution.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, Kutumb proved invaluable in the educational sector. The ‘Teachers of Bihar’ community, which had previously operated offline, seamlessly transitioned to online classes, reaching over 40,000 underprivileged children. Religious communities have also found a significant ally in Kutumb. For the ‘Khatu Shyam Ke Deewane’ group in Rajasthan, the platform facilitated daily virtual darshan and aarti during the pandemic, allowing devotees to maintain their spiritual practices despite restrictions on physical temple visits.

Looking forward, one of the significant opportunities for Kutumb lies in regional content creation. The current scarcity of quality content in regional languages presents a chance for Kutumb to lead in this area.

Kutumb’s journey reflects a broader trend of digital solutions being tailored to the unique needs of Bharat. By staying attuned to its users, embracing the rich diversity of India’s communities, and continuously adapting to their needs, Kutumb is not just connecting people—it's empowering them to thrive in their own distinct ways.
