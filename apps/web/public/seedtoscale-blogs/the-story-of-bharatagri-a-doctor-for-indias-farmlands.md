Agriculture holds ‌immense economic sway for India. It contributes about 15% to the GDP of the country and is integral to the social fabric of Bharat. With its vast consumer base and untapped opportunities, Bharat stands as a colossal market for startups.

Currently, out of 130 million farming families in India, around 70 million already own at least one smartphone. In the next few years, roughly 120 million of them will own smartphones. This digital advancement opens up a vast new market that is looking for knowledge, products, and services that were previously out of reach. Innovations within this sector will transform farming practices and pave the way for a promising future.

BharatAgri is leading the charge. Hailed as a doctor for farms, the startup is revolutionizing agriculture with cutting-edge solutions tailored to modern farming needs.

Indian farmers often lack formal education and scientific knowledge about agriculture and find themselves at a disadvantage when choosing the inputs for their crops. BharatAgri fills this gap by providing personalized, science-based advisory services that guide farmers in selecting the appropriate seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides.

The journey on BharatAgri’s platform begins with a consultation, like a patient consulting a doctor. Farmers receive tailored advice based on the unique conditions of their farm, including crop type, soil quality, and local weather conditions. This personalized guidance ensures that farmers make informed decisions, leading to better crop health and increased productivity. Once BharatAgri provides recommendations, farmers can purchase the inputs through its e-commerce platform. The products, which work as ‘medicine’ for their crops,  are then delivered to the farmers’ doorstep.

### BharatAgri’s Twin Impact  

The economic impact of BharatAgri’s services is substantial. Farmers using the platform have witnessed a ~30% rise in crop production and a ~20% reduction in costs. This benefit of higher production and lower costs translates directly into increased profits for ‌farmers.

Besides this, BharatAgri promotes sustainable agricultural practices and helps farmers minimize the use of chemical fertilizers, improving soil health, and reducing environmental damage. In the past three years, BharatAgri’s farmers have prevented approximately 17 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions, highlighting the startup’s role in fostering a more sustainable agricultural ecosystem.  

### The Changing Landscape of Bharat

The evolution of Bharat’s infrastructure has played a pivotal role in BharatAgri’s success. Improved logistics networks have enabled the platform to reach over 20,000 pin codes across India. The ability to deliver products within 3-4 days, even in the most remote areas, has bridged a significant logistical gap.

This rapid advancement in rural logistics is a testament to the changing landscape of Bharat.

“The Bharat opportunity is quite large. We feel that for India as a country, the next phase of growth will come from rural India. The rate of growth in rural India will be much faster as compared to the urban part of the country.” ~ BharatAgri Founder Siddharth Dialani

The potential for BharatAgri and other startups building for Bharat is immense. The agricultural inputs market alone represents a $44 billion opportunity, with notable scope for diversification into ancillary agricultural products and non-agricultural goods. By establishing trust, BharatAgri is enhancing the livelihoods of farmers and laying the groundwork for a broader e-commerce ecosystem in rural India.

Bharat’s emergence as a digital powerhouse offers unprecedented opportunities for startups to innovate. BharatAgri’s model of combining personalized advisory services with e-commerce, supported by a multilingual platform and robust logistics, sets a powerful example.
