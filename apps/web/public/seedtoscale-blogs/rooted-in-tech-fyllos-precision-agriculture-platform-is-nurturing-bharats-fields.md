India, with its diverse climatic zones and soil types, presents unique challenges and opportunities for agricultural innovation. Agriculture is a critical sector for the country's economy with the majority of rural households still depending on it for their livelihood.  

Fyllo, a precision agriculture platform, aims to remove guesswork from farming and bring certainty to both the quality and quantity of produce. The Greek word "fyllo" means leaf, a fitting symbol for a company that is reshaping agriculture in India. By leveraging cutting-edge agronomy models, data-backed agriculture solutions, and AI-based prediction models, Fyllo is helping farmers maximize their crop potential and achieve consistent yields.

## Ploughing Digital Fields  

Fyllo is truly a tech-based platform. It deploys IoT devices across various climatic zones—from apple orchards in Kashmir to chili fields in Andhra Pradesh’s Guntur. These devices capture data from soil, climate, and crop canopies, which is then processed using proprietary analytics algorithms on its cloud servers.

The collected data is comprehensive, including satellite imagery, crop canopy data, and farm activities reported by farmers. This extensive dataset enables Fyllo's AI models to provide precise recommendations for irrigation schedules, fertilizer application, disease and pest prediction, and weather forecasting. 

One of the standout features of Fyllo's platform is its multilingual mobile app, which delivers actionable insights to farmers in an intuitive format. The app provides live farm data, including sensor readings, historical data, and important actions to be taken. Farmers receive precise irrigation schedules based on crop type, stage, and soil conditions, as well as detailed weather predictions. This level of detail helps farmers make informed decisions and optimize their farming practices.

Fyllo's impact on Indian agriculture has been profound. The company has grown from working with just 10 farmers in its first year to over 8,000 farmers today. This rapid adoption is driven by the tangible results Fyllo delivers—farmers using the platform report 25-50% better income, 20% improved yield, and up to 80% export quality produce. **‍**

## Flourishing Opportunity

The opportunity for precision agriculture in India is vast. With 180 million hectares of agricultural land, the potential market for Fyllo's solutions exceeds $76 billion. India's diverse climatic conditions and soil types make it an ideal testing ground for Fyllo's models, which can be easily scaled globally once perfected. The company has achieved 100% customer retention, with farmers renewing their subscriptions annually. By staying close to their customers and continuously innovating, Fyllo has built a robust agronomy R&D team and deployed ground agronomists to collect data and provide on-the-ground support.

As climate change, water scarcity, and soil degradation continue to pose challenges, Fyllo's data-driven approach offers a sustainable solution for the future of farming. With a mission to increase the adoption of precision agriculture technologies, Fyllo is poised to make a significant impact on India's agricultural landscape and beyond.
