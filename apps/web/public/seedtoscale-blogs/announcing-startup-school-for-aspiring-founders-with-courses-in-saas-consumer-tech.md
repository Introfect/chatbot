Today, we at SeedToScale are relaunching our Founderstack program as a Startup School which has two carefully curated and structured courses:  
1\. [Building a Venture Backable SaaS Startup  
](https://www.seedtoscale.com/courses/founderstack-saas)2\. [Building a Consumer Tech Startup](https://www.seedtoscale.com/courses/founderstack-consumertech) ‍

SeedToScale will now also host **self-paced courses + live roundtables for discussions + meetups for founders** with insights on how to go about building venture-backable startups.

You can check out the courses for free here: [https://www.seedtoscale.com/courses](https://www.seedtoscale.com/courses)  

### Why is Accel launching courses on SeedToScale?  

Our mission at SeedToScale by Accel is to democratize the **knowledge of building venture backable companies** in as many ways as possible. Today, we are taking another small step on this mission to curate two unique courses for the first time in India.

Aspiring Indian founders who want to build SaaS & Consumer Tech companies can now learn the fundamental building blocks of how to build venture-backable startups and take them from seed to scale.

There are some very good courses already on building startups. But at times startup courses sometimes get very generic and basic. We’ve realized that founders find it useful when the content is more contextual to their idea and domain. We wanted to go deeper and be specific to SaaS & Consumer Tech Startups so that a founder can figure out nuances and details better.

We have been in beta for the last few weeks and already over 1000+ founders have already signed up for the courses. We’ve got some great feedback and are constantly improving based on this feedback.

### What are the topics covered in both our courses & by whom?

Both SaaS & Consumer Tech courses have the best experts from across the country who have built startups from Seed To Scale and are functional experts in their topic.  
  
These are designed like masterclasses where you as a founder can go fairly deep to understand the nuances with examples and tasks.
